additional installation:
I implemented RESTFUL services using Node.js.
So I installed node.js on both instances following the steps in https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_environment_setup.htm

Because I used express framewrk, I installed something according https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_express_framework.htm
and install cassandra driver by command  npm installcassandra-driver on both instances.

execution instructions:
log in EC2 intances using 
ssh -i VmKey.pem.txt ubuntu@ec2-52-202-48-81.compute-1.amazonaws.com,
ssh -i VmKey.pem.txt ubuntu@ec2-54-198-203-19.compute-1.amazonaws.com repectively.
cd /opt/tomcat/webapps/ROOT
Add /usr/local/nodejs/bin to the PATH environment variable.
node test.js

check load balancer status
note: sometimes need to reset health check so that instances are inservice.(just change the value of Unhealthy threshold as 9 for example)

now go to http://a-818399759.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/index.htm to query.
